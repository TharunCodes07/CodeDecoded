Do not include or assume any files or folders not explicitly listed.

Exclude all non-essential files such as:
- Dependency files (e.g., package.json, build.gradle, requirements.txt, pnpm-lock.yaml, etc.)
- Dotfiles and configs (e.g., .env, .gitignore, .gitattributes, README.md, etc.)
- Build tools and wrappers (e.g., gradlew, Makefile, Dockerfile)

Only consider real, relevant source folders like:
- src, app, lib, components, controllers, services, models, routes, pages, etc.

Do not hallucinate any files. Only use what is actually listed below.

Return only a JSON response with no more than 5 top-level chunks, in this exact format:

{{
  "chunkName1": [ "relative/path/to/file1", "relative/path/to/file2" ],
  "chunkName2": [ "relative/path/to/file3" ]

generate_abstractions_prompt = """For the project `{project_name}`:

Codebase Context:
{context}

Analyze the codebase context.
Identify the top 3-7 core most important abstractions to help those new to the codebase.

For each abstraction, provide:
1. A concise `name`.
2. A beginner-friendly `description` explaining what it is with a simple analogy, in around 100 words.
3. A list of relevant `file_paths` using the actual file paths.

List of files present in the context:
{file_listing}

Format the output as a JSON array of objects:

```json
[
  {{
    "name": "Query Processing",

combine_abstractions_prompt = """You are tasked with combining multiple per-chunk abstractions from a codebase into a single, cohesive final abstraction.

Project: {project_name}

Here are the individual abstractions from different chunks:
{chunk_abstractions}

Your task:
1. Analyze all the provided abstractions carefully
2. **Intelligently merge only closely related concepts** - don't force unrelated things together
3. **Preserve distinct, well-defined abstractions** - each should represent a clear, focused concept
4. **Eliminate true redundancy** while keeping important nuances that make concepts unique
5. **Maintain up to 8 high-quality abstractions** - quality over quantity
6. Ensure file paths are correctly preserved and consolidated

Return a JSON array with the final combined abstractions in this exact format:

```json
[
  {{
    "name": "Focused Concept Name",
    "description": "A detailed, well-crafted description that explains this specific abstraction clearly. Focus on what makes this concept unique and important. Aim for 100-150 words with good depth.",
    "file_paths": [
      "all/relevant/file/paths.py",
      "from/different/chunks.js"
    ]
  }}
]
```

**Smart Combination Guidelines:**
- **Only merge abstractions that are truly similar** (e.g., "User Login" + "Authentication Service" = "User Authentication System")
- **Keep distinct concepts separate** (e.g., don't merge "Database Layer" with "API Routes" - they're different concerns)
- **Preserve architectural boundaries** - respect separation of concerns
- **Each abstraction should feel complete and self-contained**
- **Aim for 5-8 well-detailed abstractions** rather than forcing everything into fewer buckets
- **Write rich descriptions** that help newcomers understand both what the abstraction does and why it matters
- **Prioritize core system components, architectural patterns, and key business logic**
